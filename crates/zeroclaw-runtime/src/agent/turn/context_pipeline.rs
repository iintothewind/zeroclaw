//! Single pre-send trim decision kernel.
//!
//! Context management is cache management: the *only* thing that should
//! decide *whether* and *how far* to trim is one comparison between a
//! provider-authoritative token count and the configured budget. Before this
//! kernel the three trim paths (preemptive turn-boundary trim, reported-budget
//! enforce, and overflow recovery) each re-derived that decision inline, so the
//! semantics drifted. They now share [`plan_pre_send_trim`].
//!
//! The one place we deliberately keep a *distinct* aggressiveness is overflow
//! recovery: when a provider has already rejected the request, a preemptive
//! "just get under budget" target may still be too big to fit next time, so we
//! force a deeper shrink to a fraction of the current size. That is the single
//! knob [`plan_pre_send_trim`] varies via `forced_shrink`.

/// The outcome of a pre-send budget check: whether to trim, and the token
/// budget the trim should drive the history down to.
