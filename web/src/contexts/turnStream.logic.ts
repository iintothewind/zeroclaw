// Pure completion/turn-stream reducer used by AgentContext's WebSocket handler
// so the production lifecycle is testable without mounting React. This file
// makes no DOM/i18n/UUID side effects; it owns only per-turn stream state,
// completion classification, and the turn's step trajectory.
//
// One store, two readers. The trajectory (`segments` + `openStep`) is the only
// place streamed text and reasoning are kept; the flat buffers
// `classifyCompletion` reads are derived from it on demand. Keeping a second
// copy of the same deltas is what let the two drift apart.
